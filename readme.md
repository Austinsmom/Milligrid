# Milligrid

Milligrid is a CSS grid system build using flexbox and Sass. You can view it in action [here](http://bencoveney.github.io/Milligrid). It is based on the [milligram](https://github.com/milligram/milligram) library.

## To do list:

+ Fix definitions for wider columns.
+ Create mixin variants of grid selectors to allow third party usage without CSS selector spam.
+ Fix text being too small.
+ Addition text element styles.
+ Convert .sass to .scss.
+ Allow optional prefixing of styles.
+ change .row-# styles to use percentages - currently break when container isn't full width.
+ Configure the build to create a grid only and full variant.
+ Publish to bower, others?

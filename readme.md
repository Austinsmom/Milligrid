Milligrid is a responsive CSS grid system which uses flexbox as a basis for its layout. It is based on the excellent grid built into [Milligram](https://milligram.github.io), which was in turn based on work by [Philip Walton](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/grids/). Milligrid aims to take the brilliant Milligram grid and provide it in a standalone package with enhanced configuration options in the form of Sass variables.

[Complete documentation](http://bencoveney.github.io/Milligrid/) is available for information on how best to utilise the grid system.
